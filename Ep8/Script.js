var a = 10;
console.log(a)


let b = 500;

// let b=544; i  cant declare duplicate because it is let 

console.log(b);
// in total program we can use anywhere in that specific block


const c = 1000;
console.log(c)
// const c=555; we cant change value of const because it is constant if we give an empty then it show syntax error and id try with force fully it gives an type error
